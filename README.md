## Nagios Visualization Tool
The MercMadness Nagios Visualization Tool is an addon for the Nagios platform.
It was originally designed to fit the needs of the Mercedes-Benz Vans manufacturing plant in Charleston, SC.

This project was created by the MercMadness team in a Software Engineering Practicum course.
